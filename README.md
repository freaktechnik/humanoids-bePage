This is the source code to my personal website, hosted at [humanoids.be](https://humanoids.be). It is currently in its eigth iteration. I try to keep previous versions available in an [archive](https://humanoids.be/archive) and make sure they aren't too broken.

## Structure

This repository includes quite a few sub-sites. [Index.vue](src/pages/Index.vue) is the main site. [Archive.vue](src/pages/Archive.vue) the archive index page, then there are the error pages constrained to [static/](static). The sitemap files are linked to by a .htaccess.

Almost all content is pulled from resume.json, a [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) file.
